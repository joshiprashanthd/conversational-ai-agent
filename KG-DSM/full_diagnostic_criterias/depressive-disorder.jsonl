This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of which is\nfrequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be\nverbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others). They\nmust occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion C) over at least\n1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in the home and at school, and they must\nbe developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B). The second manifestation of severe irritability\nconsists of chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper\noutbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of\nthe day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child’s environment (Criterion D).\n179\nThe clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully\ndistinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bipolar\ndisorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to address the\nconsiderable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of children who present\nwith chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present with classic (i.e., episodic)\nbipolar disorder.\nSome researchers view severe, nonepisodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar disorder in\nchildren, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults have distinct\nepisodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. During the\nlatter decades of the twentieth century, this contention by researchers that severe, nonepisodic\nirritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an upsurge in the rates at which\nclinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp\nincrease in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians combining at least two clinical\npresentations into a single category. That is, both classic, episodic presentations of mania and\nnonepisodic presentations of severe irritability have been labeled as bipolar disorder in children.\nIn DSM-5, the term\nbipolar disorder\nis explicitly reserved for episodic presentations of bipolar\nsymptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagnosis designed to capture youths whose hallmark\nsymptoms consisted of very severe, nonepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion\nof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations.\n", "prevalence": "Prevalence\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatricTemperamental.\nEnvironmental.\nGenetic and physiological.\nmental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the disorder in the community are unclear. In a\npopulation-based cohort study of Brazilian 11-year-olds that used a specific module for\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, the prevalence was 2.5%.\nConsistent gender differences in prevalence have not been reported in population samples,\nalthough clinic samples report a male preponderance. For example, up to 80% of children\npresenting to clinics in Turkey with features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in a chart\nreview were boys. Data suggest that the diagnosis may be more common in younger age groups\n(e.g., 8.2% in a community sample of 6-year-olds in the United States).\n", "development_and_course": "Development and Course\nThe onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years, and the\ndiagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of younger than 6 years. It\nis unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because the\nsymptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use\nof the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been\nestablished (6–18 years). Approximately half of children with disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder living in a predominantly rural area in a large U.S. study continue to have symptoms\nthat meet criteria for the condition 1 year later, although those children whose symptoms no\nlonger meet the threshold for the diagnosis often have persistent, clinically impairing irritability.\nRates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low.\nInstead, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at increased risk to develop\nunipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood.\n", "risk_and_prognostic_factors": "Risk and Prognostic Factors\nChildren with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric\nhistories. In such children, a relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common,\ntypically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic\npresentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant\n180\ndisorder. Many children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also\nmeet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety disorder,\nwith such diagnoses often being present from a relatively early age. For some children, the\ncriteria for major depressive disorder may also be met.\nFactors associated with disrupted family life, such as psychological abuse or\nneglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited parental education, single-parent household, early\ntrauma, death of a parent, parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are\nassociated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nData suggest that a family history of depression may be a risk factor for\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Consistent with this, twin data suggest that the\nassociation between early irritability and later unipolar depression and anxiety may be, in part,\ngenetically mediated.\nCompared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses, those withdisruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in\ninformation-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed\ndecision-making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder as well as\nthose with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Importantly, however, the same behavioral\ndeficit may be associated with different patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for\ndisorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to\nemotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic\nirritability.\n", "culture_related_diagnostic_issues": "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nCulture-related data on disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are limited. However,\nsociocultural factors affect the presentation of core psychological features of the disorder,\nincluding impulsivity as well as emotion, reward, threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially\nin settings characterized by severe social disruption, such as postconflict zones or communities\naffected by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to adversity that are context-dependent and\ntransitory.\n", "sex_and_gender_related_diagnostic_issues": "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere is some evidence from twin studies that while irritability has a strong genetic component\nin both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For boys, genetic factors appear to account for an\nincreasing amount of the variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While\ngenetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the irritability phenotype in\nschool-age girls, this decreases into adolescence and young adulthood, with environmental\ninfluences playing a greater role. How this genetic risk for irritability translates into risk and\nprognosis for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, per se, is not yet known.\nFunctional Consequences of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nChronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is\nassociated with marked disruption in a child’s family and peer relationships, as well as in school\nperformance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have\ndifficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically\nenjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and\nirritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. Levels of dysfunction in\nchildren with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood\n181\ndysregulation disorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause severe disruption in the\nlives of the affected individual and his or her family. In both disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common.\n", "differential_diagnosisbipolar_disorders_": "Differential DiagnosisBipolar disorders.\nOppositional defiant disorder.\nBecause chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histories,\nthe diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while considering the\npresence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider many other\nsyndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder and\noppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment.\nThe central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and\nbipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children,\nas in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete\nepisodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical presentation.\nThe mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child’s\nusual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by\nthe onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g.,\ndistractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is\ndistinctly different from the child’s usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents\n(and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time\nperiod during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. In\ncontrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present\nover many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is\ncharacteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar\ndisorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In fact, the\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever\nexperienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever\nhad a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating\nfeature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of\nelevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but\nare not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nWhile symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur\nin children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with oppositional defiant disorder. The key\nfeatures that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose\nsymptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and\nfrequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition,\nthe diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least\none setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second\nsetting. For this reason, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant\ndisorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with\noppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met.\nMoreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the prominent mood\nsymptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk for depressive and anxiety\ndisorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\namong the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional defiant disorder is included in the\nchapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and ConductAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and\nautism spectrum disorder.\nIntermittent explosive disorder.\n182\nDisorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant\ndisorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\nappears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.\nUnlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant disorder—for whom a\ndiagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be given even if the symptoms meet\ndiagnostic criteria for that disorder—children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive\ndisorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in the\ncontext of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of\nthose diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Children with disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also meet criteria for an anxiety disorder\nand can receive both diagnoses, but children whose irritability is manifest only in the context of\nexacerbation of an anxiety disorder should receive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather\nthan disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum\ndisorders frequently present with temper outbursts when, for example, their routines are\ndisturbed. In that instance, the temper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism\nspectrum disorder, and the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder.\nChildren with symptoms suggestive of intermittent explosive\ndisorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children with disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,\nintermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual’s mood to be persistently irritable\nor angry between outbursts. In addition, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving\nverbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical\ninjury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice weekly can be made after only 3\nmonths of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with\noutbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder should be made.\n", "comorbidity": "Comorbidity\nRates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to\nfind individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone.\nComorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other DSM-defined\nsyndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses; the strongest overlap is\nwith oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive\nmood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly\ndiverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior,\nmood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. However, children withdisruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar\ndisorder, as in that context, only the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have\nsymptoms that meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder\nand\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation\ndisorder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-\nprovoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.\n183\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n"}}

The essential feature of a\nmajor depressive episode is a period lasting at least 2 weeks during which there is either\ndepressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all or nearly all activities for most of the day\nnearly every day (Criterion A). The individual must also experience at least four additional\nsymptoms during the same 2-week period, drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or\nweight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt;\ndifficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions; or thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, a\nsuicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicidal behavior. To count toward a diagnosis of a major\ndepressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or have clearly worsened compared\nwith the individual’s pre-episode status. Moreover, the symptoms must occur nearly every day,\nfor at least 2 consecutive weeks, with the exception of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation,\nwhich must be recurrent, and attempting suicide or making a specific plan, which only needs tooccur once. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder\nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort. The\npresenting complaint is often insomnia or fatigue rather than depressed mood or loss of interest;\nthus, the failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms can result in underdiagnosis.\nFatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor\ndisturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the\npresence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.\nThe mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed,\nsad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness may\nbe denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the\nindividual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain of feeling\n“blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred\nfrom the individual’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic\ncomplaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many\nindividuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to\nevents with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor\nmatters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad\nor dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when\nfrustrated.\nDiminished interest or pleasure in usual activities is nearly always present, at least to some\ndegree. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, “not caring anymore,” or not\nfeeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2).\nFamily members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a\nformerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to\npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual\ninterest or desire.\n186\nAppetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. Some depressed individuals\nreport that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific\nfoods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either\ndirection), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make\nexpected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively\n(Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insomnia (i.e.,\nwaking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia\n(i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling\nasleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may\nexperience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason\nthat the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep.\nPsychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing;\nor pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech,\nthinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased involume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness) (Criterion A5). The psychomotor\nagitation or retardation must be severe enough to be observable by others and not represent\nmerely subjective feelings. Individuals who display either psychomotor disturbance (i.e.,\npsychomotor agitation or retardation) are likely to have histories of the other.\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). An individual may\nreport sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\nsubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For\nexample, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting\nand take twice as long as usual. This symptom accounts for much of the impairment resulting\nfrom major depressive disorder, both during acute episodes and when remission is incomplete.\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may include\nunrealistic negative evaluations of one’s worth or guilty preoccupations or ruminations over\nminor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-\nday events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for\nuntoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an\nindividual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming\noneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a\nresult of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to\nmeet this criterion.\nMany individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor decisions\n(Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties. Those\nengaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In children, a\nprecipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individuals, memory\ndifficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia\n(“pseudodementia”). When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory\nproblems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particularly elderly persons, a major\ndepressive episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia.\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. They\nmay range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others would be\nbetter off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of dying by suicide, to a\nspecific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put their affairs in order (e.g.,\nupdated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a rope or a gun), and chosen a\nlocation and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give\nup in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,\n187\nan intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emotional\nstate, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to others. The\nresolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than\ndenial of further plans for suicide.\nThe degree of impairment associated with a major depressive episode varies, but even in\nmilder cases, there must be either clinically significant distress or some interference in social,\noccupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B). If impairment is severe, the\nindividual may lose the ability to function socially or occupationally. In extreme cases, theindividual may be unable to perform minimal self-care (e.g., feeding and clothing self) or to\nmaintain minimal personal hygiene.\nThe individual’s report of symptoms may be compromised by difficulties in concentrating,\nimpaired memory, or a tendency to deny, discount, or explain away symptoms. Information from\nadditional informants can be especially helpful in clarifying the course of current or prior major\ndepressive episodes and in assessing whether there have been any manic or hypomanic episodes.\nBecause major depressive episodes can begin gradually, a review of clinical information that\nfocuses on the worst part of the current episode may be most likely to detect the presence of\nsymptoms.\nThe evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when\nthey occur in an individual who also has another medical condition (e.g., cancer, stroke,\nmyocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symptoms of a\nmajor depressive episode are identical to those of another medical condition (e.g., weight loss\nwith untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in pregnancy; insomnia later in\npregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a major depressive diagnosis except\nwhen they are clearly and fully attributable to another medical condition. Nonvegetative\nsymptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, impaired concentration or indecision,\nand suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases. Definitions of major\ndepressive episodes that have been modified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms\nappear to identify nearly the same individuals as do the full criteria.\n", "associated_features": "Associated Features\nMajor depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted for by\nsuicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals admitted to nursing\nhomes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. Individuals frequently\npresent with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety, phobias, excessive\nworry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g., headaches; joint, abdominal, or other\npains). In children, separation anxiety may occur.\nAlthough an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological,\nand neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test has yielded\nresults of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for this disorder.\nUntil recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been the most extensively\ninvestigated abnormality associated with major depressive episodes, and it appears to be\nassociated with melancholia (a particularly severe type of depression), psychotic features, and\nrisks for eventual suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including\ngenetic variants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally,\nvolumetric and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for\nabnormalities in specific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and\nemotion regulation in adults with major depression.\n", "prevalence": "Prevalence\nTwelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately\n7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old188\nindividuals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. The most\nreproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder has been a higher\nprevalence in females, an effect that peaks in adolescence and then stabilizes. Women experience\napproximately twofold higher rates than men, especially between menarche and menopause.\nWomen report more atypical symptoms of depression characterized by hypersomnia, increased\nappetite, and leaden paralysis compared with men.\nSystematic reviews show that the 12-month and point prevalence of major depressive\ndisorder vary eight- to ninefold across global geographic regions. In the United States,\nprevalence increased from 2005 to 2015, with steeper rates of increase for youth compared with\nolder groups. After stratification by ethnoracial groups, non-Hispanic Whites showed a\nsignificant increase in prevalence after adjustment for demographic characteristics, whereas no\nsignificant change in rate of depression was observed among non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics.\n", "development_and_course": "Development and Course\nMajor depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset increases\nmarkedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s; however, first\nonset in late life is not uncommon.\nThe course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals rarely,\nif ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or only one or\ntwo symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many years with few or\nno symptoms between discrete episodes. The course of depression may reflect social-structural\nadversity associated with poverty, racism, and marginalization.\nIt is important to distinguish individuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of\na chronic depressive illness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of\ndepressive symptoms substantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety,\nand substance use disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full\nsymptom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive\nsymptoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of\ndepressive symptoms. Cases in which depressive symptoms are present for more days than not\nmight warrant an additional diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder.\nRecovery from a major depressive episode begins within 3 months of onset for 40% of\nindividuals with major depression and within 1 year for 80% of individuals. Recency of onset is\na strong determinant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have\nbeen depressed for only several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features\nassociated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic\nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity.\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progressively lower over time as the duration of remission\nincreases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe, in younger\nindividuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple episodes. The persistence\nof even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of recurrence.\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial\nproportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will prove, inTemperamental.\nEnvironmental.\nGenetic and physiological.\nCourse modifiers.\ntime, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with onset of the\nillness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family history of bipolar\nillness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases the risk for future manic\nor hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly with psychotic features, may\nalso transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much more frequent than the reverse.\n189\nThere are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment response of major\ndepressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that hypersomnia and\nhyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic symptoms, particularly\npsychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals. Depressions with earlier ages\nat onset are more familial and more likely to involve personality disturbances. The course of\nmajor depressive disorder within individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times\nto recovery do not change over multiple episodes, and the likelihood of being in an episode does\nnot generally increase or decrease with time.\n", "risk_and_prognostic_factors": "Risk and Prognostic Factors\nNegative affectivity (neuroticism) is a well-established risk factor for the onset\nof major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more likely to develop\ndepressive episodes in response to stressful life events.\nAdverse childhood experiences, particularly when they are multiple and of\ndiverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive disorder. Women may\nbe disproportionately at risk for adverse childhood experiences, including sexual abuse, that may\ncontribute to the increased prevalence of depression in this group. Other social determinants of\nmental health, such as low income, limited formal education, racism, and other forms of\ndiscrimination, are associated with higher risk of major depressive disorder. Stressful life events\nare well recognized as precipitants of major depressive episodes, but the presence or absence of\nadverse life events near the onset of episodes does not appear to provide a useful guide to\nprognosis or treatment selection. Etiologically, women are disproportionately affected by major\nrisk factors for depression across the life span, including interpersonal trauma.\nFirst-degree family members of individuals with major depressive\ndisorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than that of the general\npopulation. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and recurrent forms. Heritability is\napproximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism accounts for a substantial portion of\nthis genetic liability.\nWomen may also be at risk for depressive disorders in relation to specific reproductive life\nstages, including in the premenstrual period, postpartum, and in perimenopause.\nEssentially all major nonmood disorders (i.e., anxiety, substance use, trauma-\nand stressor-related, feeding and eating, and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders)\nincrease the risk of an individual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop\nagainst the background of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use,\nanxiety, and borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and the\npresenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sustainedclinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate treatment of\nunderlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase risks for major\ndepressive episodes. Prevalent illnesses such as diabetes, morbid obesity, and cardiovascular\ndisease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these episodes are more likely to\nbecome chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy individuals.\n", "culture_related_diagnostic_issues": "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nAlthough there is substantial cross-cultural variation in the prevalence, course, and\nsymptomatology of depression, a syndrome similar to major depressive disorder can be\nidentified across diverse cultural contexts. Symptoms commonly associated with depression\nacross cultural contexts, not listed in the DSM criteria, include social isolation or loneliness,\nanger, crying, and diffuse pain. A wide range of other somatic complaints are\n190\ncommon and vary by cultural context. Understanding the significance of these symptoms\nrequires exploring their meaning in local social contexts.\nSymptoms of major depressive disorder may be underdetected or underreported, potentially\nleading to misdiagnosis, including overdiagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders in some\nethnic and racialized groups facing discrimination. Cross-nationally, higher levels of income\ninequality in a society are associated with higher prevalence of major depressive disorder. In the\nUnited States, the chronicity of major depressive disorder appears to be higher among African\nAmericans and Caribbean Blacks compared with non-Latinx Whites, possibly because of the\nimpact of racism, discrimination, greater sociostructural adversity, and lack of access to quality\nmental health care.\n", "sex_and_gender_related_diagnostic_issues": "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nThere are no clear differences between genders in treatment response or functional\nconsequences. There is some evidence for sex and gender differences in phenomenology and\ncourse of illness. Women tend to experience more disturbances in appetite and sleep, including\natypical features such as hyperphagia and hypersomnia, and are more likely to experience\ninterpersonal sensitivity and gastrointestinal symptoms. Men with depression, however, may be\nmore likely than depressed women to report greater frequencies and intensities of maladaptive\nself-coping and problem-solving strategies, including alcohol or other drug misuse, risk taking,\nand poor impulse control.\n", "association_with_suicidal_thoughts_or_behavior": "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior\nAge-adjusted rates of suicide in the United States have increased from 10.5 to 14.0 per 100,000\nover the past two decades. An earlier review of the literature indicated that individuals with\ndepressive illness have a 17-fold increased risk for suicide over the age- and sex-adjusted general\npopulation rate. The likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the\nrisk of death by suicide does not. The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during\nmajor depressive episodes. The most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide\nattempts or threats, but it should be remembered that most deaths by suicide are not preceded byManic episodes with irritable mood or with mixed features.\nBipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar and related disorder.\nDepressive disorder due to another medical condition.\nnonfatal attempts. Anhedonia has a particularly strong association with suicidal ideation. Other\nfeatures associated with an increased risk for death by suicide include being single, living alone,\nsocial disconnectedness, early life adversity, availability of lethal methods such as a firearm,\nsleep disturbance, cognitive and decision-making deficits, and having prominent feelings of\nhopelessness. Women attempt suicide at a higher rate than men, while men are more likely to\ncomplete suicide. The difference in suicide rate between men and women with depressive\ndisorders is smaller than in the population as a whole, however. Comorbidities, including\naggressive-impulsive traits, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety,\nother medical conditions, and functional impairment, increase risk for future suicidal behavior.\n", "functional_consequences_of_major_depressive_disorder": "Functional Consequences of Major Depressive Disorder\nMany of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual\nsymptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the affected\nindividual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range to complete\nincapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self-care needs or is\nmute or catatonic. For individuals seen in general medical settings, those with major depressive\ndisorder have more pain and physical illness and greater decreases in physical, social, and role\nfunctioning. Depressed women report greater functional impairment in their relationships than\nmen.\n191\n", "differential_diagnosis": "Differential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive episodes with prominent\nirritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or with\nmixed features. This distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of sufficient\nmanic symptoms to meet threshold criteria (i.e., three if mood is manic, four if mood is irritable\nbut not manic).\nMajor depressive\nepisodes along with a history of a manic or hypomanic episode preclude the diagnosis of major\ndepressive disorder. Major depressive episodes with a history of hypomanic episodes and\nwithout a history of manic episodes indicate a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, whereas major\ndepressive episodes with a history of manic episodes (with or without hypomanic episodes)\nindicate a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. On the other hand, presentations of major depressive\nepisodes with a history of periods of hypomania that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic\nepisode may be diagnosed as either other specified bipolar and related disorder or major\ndepressive disorder depending on where the clinician judges the presentation to best fall. For\nexample, the presentation may be best considered other specified bipolar and related disorder\nbecause of the clinical significance of the subthreshold hypomanic symptoms, or the presentation\nmay be best considered a case of major depressive disorder with some subthreshold hypomanic\nsymptoms in between episodes.\nA diagnosis of depressive disorder due to\nanother medical condition requires the presence of an etiological medical condition. MajorSubstance/medication-induced depressive disorder.\nPersistent depressive disorder.\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\nMajor depressive episodes superimposed on schizophrenia, delusional disorder,\nschizophreniform disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorder.\nSchizoaffective disorder.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood.\ndepressive disorder is not diagnosed if the major depressive–like episodes are all attributable to\nthe direct pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple\nsclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nThis disorder is distinguished from major\ndepressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin)\nappears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For example, depressed mood that\noccurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced\ndepressive disorder.\nPersistent depressive disorder is characterized by depressed mood,\nmore days than not, for at least 2 years. If criteria are met for both major depressive disorder and\npersistent depressive disorder, both can be diagnosed.\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by dysphoric\nmood that is present in the final week before the onset of menses, that starts to improve within a\nfew days after the onset of menses, and that becomes minimal or absent in the week postmenses.\nBy contrast, the episodes of major depressive disorder are not temporally connected to the\nmenstrual cycle.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by\nsevere, recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally and/or behaviorally, accompanied by\npersistent or labile mood, most of the day, nearly every day, in between the outbursts. In\ncontrast, in major depressive disorder, irritability is confined to the major depressive episodes.\nDepressive symptoms may be present during schizophrenia, delusional disorder,\nschizophreniform disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorder. Most commonly, such depressive symptoms can be considered associated\nfeatures of these disorders and do not merit a\n192\nseparate diagnosis. However, when the depressive symptoms meet full criteria for a major\ndepressive episode, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder may be made in addition to\nthe diagnosis of the psychotic disorder.\nSchizoaffective disorder differs from major depressive disorder, with\npsychotic features, by the requirement that in schizoaffective disorder, delusions or\nhallucinations are present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major depressive episode.\nDistractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in\nboth attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a major depressive episode; if the\ncriteria are met for both, ADHD may be diagnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However,\nthe clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with\nADHD whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss\nof interest.\nA major depressive episode that occurs in response to a\npsychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, by theBereavement.\nSadness.\nF34.1\nfact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder.\nBereavement is the experience of losing a loved one to death. It generally triggers\na grief response that may be intense and may involve many features that overlap with symptoms\ncharacteristic of a major depressive episode, such as sadness, difficulty sleeping, and poor\nconcentration. Features that help differentiate a bereavement-related grief response from a major\ndepressive episode include the following: the predominant affects in grief are feelings of\nemptiness and loss, whereas in a major depressive episode they are persistent depressed mood\nand a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Moreover, the dysphoric mood of grief is likely\nto decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves that tend to be associated with\nthoughts or reminders of the deceased, whereas the depressed mood in a major depressive\nepisode is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. It is important to\nnote that in a vulnerable individual (e.g., someone with a past history of major depressive\ndisorder), bereavement may trigger not only a grief response but also the development of an\nepisode of depression or the worsening of an existing episode.\nFinally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience. These\nperiods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity\n(i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly every day for at least 2\nweeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis other specified\ndepressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood with clinically\nsignificant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or severity.\n", "comorbidity": "Comorbidity\nOther disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance-related\ndisorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder.\nWhile women are more likely than men to report comorbid anxiety disorders, bulimia\nnervosa, and somatoform disorder (somatic symptom and related disorders), men are more likely\nto report comorbid alcohol and substance abuse.\n193\nPersistent Depressive Disorder\n"}}

This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic\nmajor depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depression may precede persistent\ndepressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may occur during persistent depressive\ndisorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major depressive disorder criteria for 2 years should\nbe given a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder as well as major depressive disorder.\nIndividuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or “down in the\ndumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from Criterion B\nare present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s day-to-day\nexperience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this way”), they may\nnot be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the 2-year period (1 year for\nchildren or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals that have occurred have lasted no longer\nthan 2 months (Criterion C).\n", "prevalence": "Prevalence\nPersistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and\nchronic major depressive episode.

However, the disorder is associated with\nelevated risk of suicidal outcomes and comparable levels of disability wherever it occurs.\n", "development_and_course": "Development and Course\nPersistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood,\nadolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Borderline personality\ndisorder is a particularly robust risk factor for persistent depressive disorder. When persistentTemperamental.\nEnvironmental.\nGenetic and physiological.\ndepressive disorder and borderline personality disorder coexist, the covariance of the\ncorresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mechanism.

If the symptom criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a\nmajor depressive episode at any time during this period, then the additional diagnosis of major\ndepression should be made. The comorbid presence of major depressive episodes during this\nperiod should also be noted by assigning the appropriate course specifier to the persistent\ndepressive disorder diagnosis as follows: If the individual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria\nfor a major depressive episode, and there have been periods of at least 8 weeks in at least the\npreceding 2 years with symptoms below the threshold for a full major depressive episode, then\nthe specifier “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be\nassigned. If full criteria for a major depressive episode are not currently met but there has been\none or more major depressive episodes in at least the preceding 2 years, then the specifier “with\nintermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode” is assigned. If a major\ndepressive episode\n196\nhas persisted for at least a 2-year duration and remains present, then the specifier “with persistent\nmajor depressive episode” is used.

These symptoms may be\naccompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms must have occurred in most of\nthe menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social\nfunctioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the accompanying symptoms may be closely\nrelated to social and cultural background characteristics as well as religious beliefs, social\ntolerance, attitude toward the female reproductive cycle, and female gender role issues more\ngenerally.\nTypically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses. Although it is not\nuncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must have a\nsymptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins. While the core\nsymptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic symptoms commonly\nalso occur. However, the presence of somatic and/or behavioral symptoms in the absence of\nmood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Symptoms are of comparable\nseverity (but not duration) to those of other mental disorders, such as a major depressive episode\nor generalized anxiety disorder.

Premenstrual syndrome may be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder;\nits estimated prevalence varies with numbers that hover at about 20%. While premenstrual\nsyndrome shares the feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the\nmenstrual cycle, the presence of somatic or\n200\nbehavioral symptoms, without the required affective symptoms, likely meets criteria for\npremenstrual syndrome and not for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nDysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a\nsyndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin with\nthe onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin\nbefore the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses.\nMany women with\n(either naturally occurring or substance/medication-induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder\nor persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nHowever, when they chart symptoms, they realize that the symptoms do not follow a\npremenstrual pattern. Because the onset of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may\nreport that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen\npremenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that symptoms be confirmed by\ndaily prospective ratings. The process of differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies\non retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the overlap between\nsymptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some other diagnoses. The overlap of\nsymptoms is particularly salient for differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major\ndepressive episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality\ndisorder.\nSome women who present with moderate to severe premenstrual\nsymptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contraceptives. If such\nsymptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms may be attributable to\nthe use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\nIf the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear, then this is consistent with\nsubstance/medication-induced depressive disorder.\nWomen with chronic medical conditions may experience symptoms of\npremenstrual dysphoria. As with any depressive disorder, medical conditions that could better\naccount for the symptoms should be ruled out, such as thyroid deficiency and anemia.\n", "comorbidity": "Comorbidity\nA major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals\npresenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical conditions (e.g.,\nmigraine, asthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and\nbipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in thepremenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmenstrual\ninterval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are better\nconsidered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental disorder or medical condition.\nAlthough the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situations\nin which an individual experiences only a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or\nphysical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another mental disorder or\nmedical condition if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of functioning\nthat are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the\nsymptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.\n201\nSubstance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\n"}}

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is\nbased on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For\nsubstances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other (or\nunknown) substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an\netiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the same code should also be\nused.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is\nlisted first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced\ndepressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset\nduring withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during\nwithdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine\nuse disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate\ndiagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced\ndepressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time\nheavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94\nphencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one\nsubstance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive\n203\nmood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use\ndisorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal;\nF19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).\n", "diagnostic_features": "Diagnostic Features\nThe essential feature of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is a prominent and\npersistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by\ndepressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n(Criterion A) that is due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a\nmedication, or a toxin exposure) (Criterion B). In order to meet criteria for the diagnosis, the\ndepressive symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or\nwithdrawal or after exposure to or withdrawal from a medication, as evidenced by clinical\nhistory, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B1), and the involved\nsubstance/medication must be capable of producing the depressive symptoms (Criterion B2). In\naddition, the depressed symptoms are not better explained by a non-substance/medication-\ninduced depressive disorder.\nEvidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the observation that the depressive\nsymptoms preceded the onset of substance/medication use, the depressive symptoms persist\nbeyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication,or there is other evidence that suggests the existence of an independent non-\nsubstance/medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C), such as a history of recurrent\nnon-substance-induced depressive episodes. This diagnosis should not be made when symptoms\noccur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). Finally, the diagnosis requires\nthat the substance/medication-induced depressive symptoms cause clinically significant distress\nor impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). The\nsubstance-induced depressive disorder diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of\nsubstance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A\npredominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical\nattention.\nThe two categories of drugs of abuse most likely to cause a substance/medication-induced\ndepressive disorder are depressants (e.g., intoxication with alcohol, benzodiazepines and other\nsedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs) and stimulants (e.g., withdrawal from amphetamine-type\nsubstances and cocaine). Some medications (e.g., steroids; antihypertensive medications such as\nclonidine, guanethidine, methyldopoa, and reserpine; interferon;\nL\n-dopa) are especially likely to\ncause substance/medication-induced depressive syndromes. Substances implicated in\nmedication-induced depressive disorder, with varying degrees of evidence, include antibiotics,\nantiviral agents (efavirenz), cardiovascular agents (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers,\nretinoic acid derivatives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antimigraine agents\n(triptans), antipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-\nreleasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), chemotherapeutic drugs, and smoking cessation agents\n(varenicline). This list is likely to grow as new compounds are synthesized.\nClear clinical histories and careful judgment are essential in determining whether the\nsubstance of abuse or medication is truly associated with induced depressive symptoms or\nwhether the symptoms are better understood as constituting an independent depressive disorder.\nA diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is most likely if the\nindividual was taking high doses of a relevant drug of abuse or medication and there is no past\nhistory of independent depressive episodes. For example, a depressive episode that developed in\nthe context of heavy use of a relevant substance of abuse or within the first several weeks of\nbeginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individual with no history of\nmajor depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of a substance- or medication-induced\ndepressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition (e.g., major depressive\ndisorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is\n204\ncoincidentally taking a drug or medication that has the capacity to cause depressive\nsymptoms (e.g., alcohol and/or stimulants in context of heavy use,\nL\n-dopa, oral contraceptives).\nIn all of these cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the medication is\ncausative in this particular situation.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from an independent\ndepressive disorder by the onset or course, or by other factors associated with the substance or\nmedication use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory\nfindings of use of a drug of abuse or a medication that is capable of producing depressive\nsymptoms after exposure to, withdrawal from, or intoxication with that substance prior to theonset of the depressive disorder. The neurochemical changes associated with intoxication and\nwithdrawal states for some substances can be relatively protracted, and thus intense depressive\nsymptoms can last for a longer period after the cessation of substance use and still be consistent\nwith a diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.\n", "prevalence": "Prevalence\nThe lifetime rate of alcohol- and stimulant-induced depressive episodes has been reported to be\n40% or higher among individuals with relevant substance use disorders. However, in a nationally\nrepresentative U.S. adult population, the lifetime prevalence of substance/medication-induced\ndepressive disorder in the absence of a lifetime history of non-substance-induced depressive\ndisorder was only 0.26%. These data indicate that special care must be taken to search for and\naddress substance-induced conditions in individuals with alcohol and stimulant use disorders.\n", "development_and_course": "Development and Course\nA depressive disorder associated with the use of substances (e.g., alcohol, amphetamine-type\nsubstances and/or cocaine, or a prescribed treatment for medical conditions) must have its onset\nwhile the individual is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal\nsyndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has its onset within\nthe first few weeks or 1 month of heavy use of the substance. Once the substance is discontinued,\nthe depressive symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks, depending on the half-life\nof the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome. If symptoms persist 4\nweeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal of a particular substance/medication, other\ncauses for the depressive mood symptoms should be considered.\nThere are several prospective controlled trials examining the association of depressive\nsymptoms with use of a prescribed medication, but most reports on this topic involve\nretrospective series of individuals entering treatment, or participants in large cross-sectional\nstudies. More studies exist regarding the clinical course of alcohol- and illicit drug–induced\ndepressions, and most support the contention that the substance-induced conditions are very\nlikely to fade away within a relatively short time after abstinence.

In addition, neurochemical changes associated with alcohol and other drugs of abuse\noften contribute to depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal that subsequently\ninfluence ongoing substance use and reduce the likelihood of remission of substance use\ndisorders.

A diagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder\nshould be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when\nthe mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For\nexample, dysphoric mood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance-induced\ndepressive disorder with onset during withdrawal should be diagnosed instead of cocaine\nwithdrawal only if the mood disturbance in Criterion A predominates in the clinical picture and\nis sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment.\nA substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is\ndistinguished from an independent depressive disorder by the fact that even though a substance is\ntaken in high enough amounts to be possibly etiologically related to the symptoms, if the\ndepressive syndrome is observed at times other than when the substance or medication is being\nused, it should be diagnosed as an independent depressive disorder.\nBecause individuals with medical conditions\noften take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the\nmood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather\nthan the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another medical condition is\ndiagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change\nin the treatment for the medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may\nbe needed to determine empirically whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician\nhas ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both another medical condition and substance\nuse or withdrawal, then both diagnoses (i.e., depressive disorder due to another medicalcondition and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder) may be given.

The listing of the\nmedical conditions that are said to be able to induce major depression is never complete, and the\nclinician’s best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis.\nThere are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of depression with\ncerebrovascular accident (CVA), Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI). Among the neuroendocrine conditions most closely associated with depression are\nCushing’s syndrome and hypothyroidism. Autoimmune disorders, such systemic lupus\nerythematosus, and deficiencies of certain vitamins, such as vitamin B\n12\n, have also been linked\nto depression. There are numerous other conditions thought to be associated with depression,\nsuch as multiple sclerosis. However, the literature’s support for a causal association is greaterwith some conditions than with others. Currently, there is support for a direct pathophysiological\nmechanism for depressive symptoms in focal lesions (CVA, TBI, neoplasm) affecting certain\nbrain regions, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome,\nand pancreatic cancer.\n", "prevalence": "Prevalence\nSex differences in prevalence depend somewhat on the sex difference associated with the\nmedical condition (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in women; stroke is\nsomewhat more common in middle-age men compared with women).\n", "development_and_course": "Development and Course\nFollowing stroke, the onset of depression appears to be acute, occurring within a few days of the\nCVA in the largest case series. However, in some cases, onset of the depression is weeks to\nmonths following the CVA. In the largest series, the duration of the major depressive episode\nfollowing stroke was 9–11 months on average. With Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s\ndisease, depression often precedes the major motor impairments and cognitive impairments\nassociated with each condition. This is more prominently the case for Huntington’s disease, in\nwhich depression is considered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some\nobservational evidence that depression is less common as the neurocognitive disorder due to\nHuntington’s disease progresses. In some individuals with static brain injuries and other central\nnervous system diseases, mood symptoms may be episodic (i.e., recurring) over the course of the\ndisorder. In Cushing’s syndrome and hypothyroidism, depression can be an early manifestation\nof the disease. In pancreatic cancer, depression often precedes other features.\n", "risk_and_prognostic_factors": "Risk and Prognostic Factors\nThe risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a week\nof the event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk associated\nwith left frontal strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal lesions\n208\nin those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with frontal regions\nand laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur in the 2–6 months following stroke,\nperhaps indicative of later depressive symptoms representing major depressive disorder,\nadjustment disorder, or demoralization. In individuals with Parkinson’s disease, early age at\nonset, greater burden of motor symptoms, and longer duration of the disease have been\nassociated with depression. Risk of depression after TBI has been associated with female gender,\nprior depressive disorder, early psychiatric symptoms following injury, lower brain volume, and\nunemployment.\n", "sex_and_gender_related_diagnostic_issues": "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nWomen may be at differentially higher risk for developing depression in the setting of\ncardiovascular disease, particularly poststroke.Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition.\nMedication-induced depressive disorder.\nDelirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder.\nAdjustment disorders.\n", "diagnostic_markers": "Diagnostic Markers\nDiagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., steroid levels in\nblood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can be associated\nwith manic or depressive syndromes).\n", "association_with_suicidal_thoughts_or_behavior": "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior\nThere are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to differentiate the risk of suicide\nfrom a major depressive episode due to another medical condition compared with the risk from a\nmajor depressive episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in association with major\ndepressive episodes associated with another medical condition. There is a clear association\nbetween serious medical illnesses and suicide, particularly shortly after onset or diagnosis of the\nillness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the risk of suicide for major depressive episodes\nassociated with medical conditions is not less than that for other forms of major depressive\nepisode, and might even be greater.\n", "differential_diagnosis": "Differential Diagnosis\nDetermination of whether a medical\ncondition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends on a) the absence\nof an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical condition, b) the\nprobability that the associated medical condition has a potential to promote or cause a depressive\ndisorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset or worsening of the\nmedical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the time that the medical\ndisorder is effectively treated or remits.\nAn important caveat is that some medical conditions are\ntreated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic\nsymptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is the best way to\ntry to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e.,\nassociation with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced syndrome).\nA separate diagnosis of depressive disorder due\nto another medical condition is not given if the depressive disturbance occurs exclusively during\nthe course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of depressive disorder due to another medical\ncondition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder if the\ndepressive disturbance is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process\ncausing the neurocognitive disorder and if symptoms of depression are a prominent part of the\nclinical presentation.\nIt is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment\ndisorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could\n209\nbring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major\ndifferentiating elements are the pervasiveness of the depressive picture and the number and\nquality of the depressive symptoms that the individual reports or demonstrates on the mentalDemoralization.\nstatus examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but\nlargely beyond the scope of the present manual.\nDemoralization is a common reaction to chronic medical illness. It is marked by\na sense of subjective incompetence, helplessness, and hopelessness, and a desire to give up. It is\noften accompanied by depressive symptoms such as low mood and fatigue. Demoralization\ntypically lacks the anhedonia associated with depressive disorder due to another medical\ncondition, and individuals will generally find pleasure in previously meaningful activities and be\nable to experience moments of happiness.\n"}}
