Diaphragmatic Breathing (Abdominal Breathing),"Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as abdominal breathing, engages the diaphragm fully, allowing for deeper and more efficient breaths. This technique has been shown to significantly reduce stress and anxiety levels by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system. Research indicates that diaphragmatic breathing can lower cortisol levels, which are often elevated during stress. By shifting from shallow chest breathing to deep abdominal breathing, individuals can enhance oxygen exchange, improve focus and attention, and foster a sense of calm. This practice can also aid in better sleep by helping to quiet the mind and relax the body, making it easier to transition into a restful state.","Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, in a quiet environment.
