        "description": "Diaphragmatic Breathing (Abdominal Breathing)",
        "reasoning": "Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as abdominal breathing, engages the diaphragm fully, allowing for deeper and more efficient breaths. This technique has been shown to significantly reduce stress and anxiety levels by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system. Research indicates that diaphragmatic breathing can lower cortisol levels, which are often elevated during stress. By shifting from shallow chest breathing to deep abdominal breathing, individuals can enhance oxygen exchange, improve focus and attention, and foster a sense of calm. This practice can also aid in better sleep by helping to quiet the mind and relax the body, making it easier to transition into a restful state.",
        "howto": "Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, in a quiet environment.\r\nPlace one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.\r\nInhale deeply through your nose, allowing your abdomen to rise while keeping your chest relatively still. Focus on filling your lower lungs with air.\r\nExhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your abdomen fall. Aim for a longer exhalation than inhalation.\r\nContinue this pattern for 5-10 minutes, focusing on the rise and fall of your abdomen and allowing any tension to release with each breath.",
