        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI=short health anxiety inventory) in a sample of patients diagnosed with cancer. Factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and gender differences in SHAI scores were assessed. 202 patients diagnosed with cancer participated, with 18 questionnaires excluded for incomplete data. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to confirm the factor structure. Internal consistency was also assessed using Cronbach's alpha. A two-factor model (thought intrusion and fear of illness) provided the best fit for the data (SB\u03c7<sup>2</sup> (64)\u00a0=\u00a0114.346, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, CFI\u00a0=\u00a00.944, GFI\u00a0=\u00a00.908, RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a00.065). Internal consistency was high for the SHAI total score (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.864) and its subscales (thought intrusion: \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.753; fear of illness: \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.825). Female patients also scored significantly higher than male patients on the SHAI total score (U\u00a0=\u00a05232.500, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), thought intrusion subscale (U\u00a0=\u00a05189.00, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and fear of illness subscale (U\u00a0=\u00a05069.500, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). The SHAI demonstrates adequate psychometric properties for assessing health anxiety in cancer patients.",

        "title": "Enhancing Research Involvement of Young People With Lived Expertise: Reflecting on Experiences in Digital Mental Health Research.",
        "abstract": "Given the rapid development of digital mental health technologies and a focus on connecting with youth, there is an urgent need to enhance the engagement of young people with lived expertise in research. Even so, youth with lived experience of accessing mental health services are particularly affected by power imbalances and may receive limited compensation in academic settings. Therefore, an emphasis on how research engagement not only improves the work but can benefit young people themselves is required. Here, 5 young people with lived expertise report on their experience of being employed as researchers at the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre. As such, this team is uniquely placed to offer reflections from their work across multiple stages of research. This led to four key insights, including (1) creating accepting work cultures, (2) providing diverse opportunities for involvement, (3) giving young people agency and flexibility around sharing lived experiences, and (4) creating accommodating work environments for all researchers. We suggest that these insights can support more diverse ways of engaging young people and maximizing the value of participation for both researchers and young people themselves.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial neural networks trained on extensive datasets to accurately understand and generate natural language. While they have received much attention and demonstrated potential in digital health, their application in mental health, particularly in clinical settings, has generated considerable debate. This systematic review aims to critically assess the use of LLMs in mental health, specifically focusing on their applicability and efficacy in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical settings. By systematically collating and assessing the evidence from current studies, our work analyzes models, methodologies, data sources, and outcomes, thereby highlighting the potential of LLMs in mental health, the challenges they present, and the prospects for their clinical use. Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this review searched 5 open-access databases: MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM Digital Library. Keywords used were (mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry) AND (large language models). This study included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, and excluded articles published in languages other than English. In total, 40 articles were evaluated, including 15 (38%) articles on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text analysis, 7 (18%) on the use of LLMs as mental health conversational agents, and 18 (45%) on other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health. LLMs show good effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, destigmatized eHealth services. However, assessments also indicate that the current risks associated with clinical use might surpass their benefits. These risks include inconsistencies in generated text; the production of hallucinations; and the absence of a comprehensive, benchmarked ethical framework. This systematic review examines the clinical applications of LLMs in mental health, highlighting their potential and inherent risks. The study identifies several issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of generated content, challenges in interpretability due to the \"black box\" nature of LLMs, and ongoing ethical dilemmas. These ethical concerns include the absence of a clear, benchmarked ethical framework; data privacy issues; and the potential for overreliance on LLMs by both physicians and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practices. As a result, LLMs should not be considered substitutes for professional mental health services. However, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as valuable clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.

        "abstract": "This study will evaluate the Basic Income for Care Leavers in Wales pilot (BIP), which is the most generous basic income scheme in the world. A cohort of care-experienced young people who become aged 18 during a 12-month enrolment period (July 2022-June 2023) are receiving \u00a31,600 (before tax) per month for two years, and the Welsh Government intends this to have a range of benefits. This evaluation will examine the impact of BIP, the implementation of the pilot and how it is experienced, and its value for money. The study is a theory-based quasi-experimental evaluation, and the design and methods are informed by ongoing co-production with care-experienced young people. We will estimate the impact of BIP on participants using self-reported survey data and routinely collected administrative data. This will include outcomes across a range of domains, including psychological wellbeing, physical and mental health, financial impact, education, training and volunteering. Comparisons between temporal (Welsh) and geographical (English, using administrative data) controls will be done using coarsened exact matching and difference in differences analysis. The process evaluation will examine how BIP is implemented and experienced, primarily through monitoring data (quantitative) and interview, observational, and focus group data (qualitative). The economic evaluation will take a public sector and a societal perspective to identify, measure and value the costs and outcomes of BIP, and to synthesise the evidence to inform a social cost-benefit analysis at 24 months post-intervention. BIP is unusual in that it targets a wide range of outcomes and is available to an entire national cohort of participants. The evaluation also has several practical constraints. Therefore, the study will use a range of methods and triangulate between different analyses to assess how successful it is. Findings will inform policy in relation to care leavers, social security and basic income studies worldwide.",

        "abstract": "This is a qualitative study exploring the perceptions of mental health among Somali women living in London. Participants, over the age of 18, female and identifying as Somali, were recruited from a community centre in West London. Seven participants were recruited and semi-structured interviews were conducted to better understand perceptions of mental health, care-seeking, treatment and different understandings of these issues within the Somali community in London. Interview transcripts were imported into NVIVO version 14 to be coded, and description-focussed coding and thematic analysis were used to interpret key themes. Concerns around judgement, shame and stigma are key issues affecting attitudes towards mental health in this group. Other important issues affecting conceptualisations and attitudes towards mental health were intergenerational differences, isolation from the community, stigma and secrecy. Participants also reported the importance of protective factors, particularly faith and family in their lives. This research adds to existing literature in exploring perceptions of mental health in Somali communities in the UK and such research is helpful in identifying cultural barriers to recognition and treatment of mental health within this community.",

        "abstract": "Locking or confinement of persons with severe mental illness has been common in Indonesia. In 2010, the Ministry of Health declared a policy that persons who were locked (pasung) should be unlocked or freed (bebas) from confinement and provided mental health services. This study is an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of one Bebas Pasung program in Indonesia at two-year follow-up. From medical records in Soerojo Mental Hospital, Magelang, Central Java, 114 persons with severe mental illness who had been unlocked, treated, and returned to the community from four districts served by the hospital were identified. At two-year follow-up, 62 caregivers were able to be contacted and willing to participate in a study. Data were collected from hospital records about condition of the patient at time of \"unlocking\" and at discharge, and primary caregivers were interviewed about the previous locking and care of the patient since return, as well as experiences of caregiving. We provide descriptive data concerning history of illness, reasons for locking, type of confinement, and care of the individual since return. 58% of those unlocked were men, 80% had diagnoses of schizophrenia, and mean age was 35. At follow-up, 24% of this sample had been re-locked; only 44% took medications regularly, including 33% of those re-locked and 47% of those not relocked. A majority cared for themselves, half were partially or fully productive, and the quality of life of family caregivers improved significantly since their family member was unlocked, treated, and returned home. This program successfully unlocked, treated, and returned to their homes persons with severe mental illness living in pasung or restraints. Findings suggest such unlocking programs need to be linked more closely to community-based mental health and rehabilitation services, maintain care of the patient, and provide a path toward recovery.",

        "abstract": "Given the unique experiences of military service members and their families, military-dependent young adults (18-25\u2009years old) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their military or veteran families experience unique barriers to accessing quality mental health care during the transition to adulthood. In fact, developing services to address ASD challenges for military families is a burgeoning area of interest for the department of defense. However, there is a limited knowledge on the specific needs of military families as the young adult's transition outside of high school and lose supports. The present study conducted 3 focus groups with 16 military and veteran parents, and 3 focus groups with 10 military-dependent young adults to evaluate the needs of military-dependent young adults (17-25\u2009years old) with ASD and military/veteran parents with a young adult with ASD. Parents reported several key topics, including barriers to services (e.g., permanent change of station, recently moving to a state and lacking awareness of the available resources), defining adulthood in terms working in a cohesive family structure, and therapy recommendations for parents and young adults with ASD transitioning to adulthood. Young adults provided key information, including describing experiences with having a parent in the military, difficulty accessing services during the transition to adulthood, and recommendations on therapy for military-dependent young adults with ASD. Military and veteran families with autistic dependents lack access to important mental-health resources. When developing programs for military families and military-dependent autistic young adults, mental health providers should consider the frequent relocations, lack of access to important transition resources, and common military values. The presence of advocates at military bases should be encouraged to help military families navigate autism services in their local community.",

        "title": "Exploring the Role of Mobile Apps for Insomnia in Depression: Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected mental health, leading to an increased prevalence of depression and insomnia. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have thoroughly transformed health care-related mobile apps, offered more effective mental health support, and alleviated the psychological stress that may have emerged during the pandemic. Early reviews outlined the use of mobile apps for dealing with depression and insomnia separately. However, there is now an urgent need for a systematic evaluation of mobile apps that address both depression and insomnia to reveal new applications and research gaps. This study aims to systematically review and evaluate mobile apps targeting depression and insomnia, highlighting their features, effectiveness, and gaps in the current research. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2017 and 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies that (1) focused on mobile apps addressing both depression and insomnia, (2) involved young people or adult participants, and (3) provided data on treatment efficacy. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Title and abstract screening, as well as full-text screening, were completed in duplicate. Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer, and risk of bias assessments were completed accordingly. Of the initial 383 studies we found, 365 were excluded after title, abstract screening, and removal of duplicates. Eventually, 18 full-text articles met our criteria and underwent full-text screening. The analysis revealed that mobile apps related to depression and insomnia were primarily utilized for early detection, assessment, and screening (n=5 studies); counseling and psychological support (n=3 studies); and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n=10 studies). Among the 10 studies related to depression, our findings showed that chatbots demonstrated significant advantages in improving depression symptoms, a promising development in the field. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the effectiveness of mobile apps as alternative interventions for depression and sleep, further expanding the potential applications of this technology. The integration of AI and deep learning into mobile apps, particularly chatbots, is a promising avenue for personalized mental health support. Through innovative features, such as early detection, assessment, counseling, and CBT, these apps significantly contribute toward improving sleep quality and addressing depression. The reviewed chatbots leveraged advanced technologies, including natural language processing, machine learning, and generative dialog, to provide intelligent and autonomous interactions. Compared with traditional face-to-face therapies, their feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy highlight their user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible nature with the aim of enhancing sleep and mental health outcomes.",

In this paper, we first review the history of rating systems used to evaluate AI mental health interventions. We then describe the recently introduced Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), whose scoring system allows users to grade AI mental health platforms on key domains, including credibility, user experience, crisis management, user agency, health equity, and transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the use of FAITA-Mental Health scale by systematically applying it to OCD Coach, a generative AI tool readily available on the ChatGPT store and designed to help manage the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results offer insights into the utility and limitations of FAITA-Mental Health when applied to \"real-world\" generative AI platforms in the mental health space, suggesting that the framework effectively identifies key strengths and gaps in AI-driven mental health tools, particularly in areas such as credibility, user experience, and acute crisis management.

        "abstract": "Blended care therapy models are intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of evidence-based psychotherapy by combining synchronous and asynchronous components of care. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical effects of synchronous video therapy sessions and asynchronous guided practice session elements on anxiety and depression in a blended care therapy program, with a novel focus on asynchronous provider feedback messages. Participants were adults (N=33,492) with clinical symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [GAD-7] score of \u22658) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale [PHQ-9] score of \u226510) at intake. Symptom trajectories were evaluated via individual growth curve models. Time-varying covariates evaluated effects of synchronous video session attendance and the presence or absence of each asynchronous guided practice session element occurring within 7 days and 8-14 days prior to each clinical outcome assessment. Guided practice session elements included client digital lesson completion, client digital exercise completion, and feedback messages sent by providers. Approximately 86.6% (29,012/33,492) of clients met criteria for clinical improvement by end of care (median 6, IQR 4-8 synchronous sessions). Synchronous video session attendance and client digital lesson completion in the past 7 days and in the past 8-14 days were each uniquely and significantly associated with lower GAD-7 scores (video session effects: b<sub>session7</sub>=-0.82, b<sub>session8-14</sub>=-0.58, P values<.001; digital lesson effects: b<sub>lesson7</sub>=-0.18, b<sub>lesson8-14</sub>=-0.26, P values <.001) and PHQ-9 scores (video session effects: b<sub>session7</sub>=-0.89, b<sub>session8-14</sub>=-0.67, P values <.001; digital lesson effects: b<sub>lesson7</sub>=-0.12, b<sub>lesson8-14</sub>=-0.30, P values <.001). Client digital exercise completion in the past 8-14 days was significantly associated with lower GAD-7 scores (b<sub>exercise8-14</sub>=-0.10; P<.001) but exercise completion in the 7 days prior to clinical outcome assessment was not (b<sub>exercise7</sub>=0.00; P=.89). Exercise completion in the past 7 days was significantly associated with lower PHQ-9 scores (b<sub>exercise7</sub>=-0.16; P<.001) but exercise completion in the past 8-14 days was not (b<sub>exercise8-14</sub>=-0.05; P=.09). Provider feedback messaging in the past 7 days and in the past 8-14 days was significantly associated with lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, respectively (GAD-7: b<sub>feedback7</sub>=-0.12, P<.001; b<sub>feedback8-14</sub>=-0.07, P=.004; PHQ-9: b<sub>feedback7</sub>=-0.15, P<.001; b<sub>feedback8-14</sub>=-0.08, P=.01). Provider feedback between synchronous therapy sessions provided significant benefit for symptom reduction, beyond the effects of client digital engagement and synchronous video sessions. When guided practice sessions are well integrated into care, blended care therapy provides meaningful improvements upon the traditional, synchronous session-only therapy model. Provider guidance and feedback for clients between synchronous sessions support more efficient and effective mental health care overall.",

        "abstract": "The field of mental health technology presently has significant gaps that need addressing, particularly in the domain of daily monitoring and personalized assessments. Current noninvasive devices such as wristbands and smartphones are capable of collecting a wide range of data, which has not yet been fully used for mental health monitoring. This study aims to introduce a novel dataset for personalized daily mental health monitoring and a new macro-micro framework. This framework is designed to use multimodal and multitask learning strategies for improved personalization and prediction of emotional states in individuals. Data were collected from 298 individuals using wristbands and smartphones, capturing physiological signals, speech data, and self-annotated emotional states. The proposed framework combines macro-level emotion transformer embeddings with micro-level personalization layers specific to each user. It also introduces a Dynamic Restrained Uncertainty Weighting method to effectively integrate various data types for a balanced representation of emotional states. Several fusion techniques, personalization strategies, and multitask learning approaches were explored. The proposed framework was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient, resulting in a score of 0.503. This result demonstrates the framework's efficacy in predicting emotional states. The study concludes that the proposed multimodal and multitask learning framework, which leverages transformer-based techniques and dynamic task weighting strategies, is superior for the personalized monitoring of mental health. The study indicates the potential of transforming daily mental health monitoring into a more personalized app, opening up new avenues for technology-based mental health interventions.",

Improved accuracy of wearable biosensors and remote field biologic sample collection strategies could make critical contributions to understanding how physical readiness and occupational stressors result in on-the-job and environment-related injury, sleep impairments, diagnosis of mental health disorders, and reductions in performance in war-fighters. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of intensive biomarker and biometric data collection to understand physiological and psychological stress in Army Reserved Officer Training Corps cadets before, during, and after a 96-hour field training exercise (FTX). A prospective pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of multimodal field data collection using passive drool saliva sampling, sweat sensors, accelerometry, actigraphy, and photoplethysmography. In addition, physical fitness (Army Combat Fitness Test), self-reported injury, and psychological resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) were measured. A total of 22 cadets were included. Two were lost to follow-up due to injury during FTX, for a retention rate of 91%. Assessments of performance and psychological resilience were completed for all remaining participants, resulting in 100% testing adherence. All participants provided saliva samples before the FTX, with 98% adherence at the second time point and 91% at the third. For sweat, data collection was not possible. Average daily wear time for photoplethysmography devices was good to excellent, meeting a 70% threshold with data collected for \u226580% of person-days at all time points. Of the participants who completed the FTX and 12 completed a post-FTX acceptability survey for a response rate of 60%.

The purpose of this review article is to provide information on the mental health treatment needs of service members (SMs) engaged in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation. It also aims to offer a framework for an integrated treatment approach to address the cognitive and psychological health needs of warfighters. We review the prevalence and outcomes associated with comorbid TBI and PTSD and present relevant access to care considerations. Additionally, we identify an integrated approach to TBI treatment which takes psychological trauma into consideration. We introduce a trauma-informed care (TIC) model with specified diagnostic and treatment considerations for the service member and veteran (SM/V) communities. TIC is a strengths-based framework that raises the system-wide awareness of treatment facilities to the impact of psychological trauma on behavioral health. A comprehensive diagnostic approach is recommended with considerations for symptom etiology. Clinical considerations derived from available guidelines are identified to meet critical treatment needs for SM/Vs presenting for TBI treatment with a remote history of mTBI and psychological trauma or known PTSD. Clinical practice guidelines are used to inform an integrated TBI treatment model and maximize rehabilitation efforts for warfighters. Given the prevalence of comorbid TBI and PTSD among SM/Vs and its impact on outcomes, this review presents the integration of appropriate diagnostics and treatment practices, including the incorporation of CPGs into TBI rehabilitation.",

        "title": "Naturalistic Eye Movement Tasks in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "Eye tracking assessments in the laboratory have previously highlighted clear differences in eye movements between Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy aging. However, laboratory-based eye movement tasks are artificial and limit the ecological validity of observed results. Eye movement tasks utilizing more naturalistic scenarios may provide more accurate insight into cognitive function but research in this area is limited. This systematic review aims to ascertain what naturalistic tasks have revealed about oculomotor deficits in PD and what this information may help us understand about the underlying sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a literature search of PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted using predetermined search terms. Articles including both individuals with PD and healthy older adults completing eye tracking tasks involving naturalistic eye movements (e.g., reading, video-watching, unrestricted visual search) or naturalistic stimuli were included. After screening, 30 studies were identified as matching the inclusion criteria. Results revealed consistent findings across tasks, including longer fixation durations and smaller saccadic amplitudes in PD compared to healthy aging. However, inconsistencies in the literature and a lack of standardization in tasks limit interpretation of these results. Naturalistic eye movement tasks highlight some consistent differences in eye movements between people with PD and healthy aging. However, future research should expand the current literature in this area and strive towards standardization of naturalistic tasks that can preferably be conducted remotely.",
        "questions": "Does a systematic review find consistent differences in eye movements between individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults utilizing naturalistic scenarios?\n\nCorrect Answer: Yes\nDistractor 1: No difference was found in eye movements between individuals with PD and healthy aging (2022) but future will examine more.\nDistractor 2: The naturalistic scenarios only improved eye movement accuracy in individuals with PD.\nDistractor 3: Results revealed that eye movements of individuals with PD and healthy aging go to be exactly the same."

        "title": "Mediating Effect of Firefighters' Resilience and Public Service Motivation Regarding the Influence of Depression on Their Work Engagement During COVID-19.",
        "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of resilience or public service motivation (PSM) on firefighters' work engagement during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted an online survey with 304 firefighters assigned to Gyeonggi-do between October 27 and 28, 2022, and collected their demographic information; work-related data; mood, anxiety and insomnia symptoms; and work-related attitudes. The leading causes of firefighters' stress were physical and mental health decline due to heavy workloads (46.4%), verbal abuse and assault from civilians (33.9%), conflict with coworkers (18.4%), and death of colleagues (13.2%). The results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that high levels of resilience (OR\u2009=\u20091.28, p\u2009<\u20090.001), service motivation (OR\u2009=\u20091.17, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and non-exposure to death (OR\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009=\u20090.005) led to high work engagement. Mediation analysis showed that resilience and PSM mediated the influence of depression on work engagement. The work engagement of firefighters is influenced by resilience, PSM, and exposure to death.",
        "questions": "Question: Do high levels of resilience mediate the influence of depression on work engagement in firefighters?\n\nCorrect Answer: Yes\nDistractor 1: No\nDistractor 2: High levels of service motivation are the primary factors influencing work engagement in firefighters.\nDistractor 3: Resilience, but not public service motivation, mediate the influence of depression on work engagement."

        "title": "No Benefit of 3% Hypertonic Saline Following Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage.",
        "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a stroke subtype with a high mortality rate (~\u200940%). After ICH, the mass effect of the hematoma and edema contribute to raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and poor outcome. Endogenous compensatory mechanisms that blunt ICP elevations include redirection of venous blood and cerebrospinal fluid, along with brain tissue compliance (e.g., decreased cell volume, increased cell density); however, these limited reserves can be exhausted after severe stroke, resulting in decompensated ICP that requires careful clinical management. Management strategies can include administration of hypertonic saline (HTS), an osmotic agent that putatively attenuates edema, and thereby ICP elevations. Evidence regarding the efficacy of HTS treatment following ICH remains limited. In this study, adult male rats were given a collagenase-induced striatal ICH and a bolus of either 3% HTS or 0.9% saline vehicle at 2- and 14-hours post-stroke onset. Neurological deficits, edema, ipsilateral cell volume and density (in areas S1 and CA1), and contralateral CA1 ultrastructural morphology were assessed 24\u00a0h post-ICH. Animals had large bleeds (median 108.2 \u00b5L), extensive edema (median 83.9% brain water content in ipsilateral striatum), and evident behavioural deficits (median 5.4 neurological deficit scale score). However, HTS did not affect edema (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.4797), behaviour (p\u2009=\u20090.6479), cell volume (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.1079), or cell density (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.0983). Qualitative ultrastructural assessment of contralateral area CA1 suggested that HTS administration was associated with paradoxical cellular swelling in ICH animals. Overall, there was no benefit with administering 3% HTS after ICH.",
        "questions": "Question: Does administration of 3% hypertonic saline have a beneficial effect on patients with intracerebral hemorrhage?\n Correct Answer: No\n Distractor 1: There is no significant impact of 3% hypertonic saline on intracerebral hemorrhage, but it may be useful in other types of strokes.\n Distractor 2: Administration of 3% hypertonic saline appears to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, but has a negative effect on neurological function.\n Distractor 3: This study does not investigate the administration of 3% hypertonic saline, its effects are unknown at the time of study."

        "title": "How Late Nights Influence Brain Cortical Structures: Distinct Neuroanatomical Measures Associated With Late Chronotype in Young Adults.",
        "abstract": "Chronotype is an inherent physiological trait reflecting an individual's subjective preference for their sleep awakening time, exerting a substantial influence on both physical and mental well-being. While existing research has established a close relationship between chronotype and individual brain structure, prior studies have predominantly focused on individual measurements of brain structural scales, thereby limiting the exploration of the underlying mechanisms of structural changes. This study seeks to validate previous research findings and enhance our understanding of the correlation between circadian rhythm preference and diverse cortical indicators in healthy young individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and chronotype assessments were conducted once for all participants, comprising 49 late chronotype (LC) young adults and 49 matched early chronotype young adults. The Chronotype Questionnaire was utilized to assess morningness and eveningness preferences. Surface-based analysis of structural MRI data revealed that LC young adults exhibited thinner cortical thickness of left pars orbitalis and lower cortical mean curve of right paracentral gyrus. Overall, this study represents a significant advancement in elucidating the connection between brain structure and function within the context of chronotypes.",
        "questions": "Does a relationship between late chronotype and cortical thickness on left pars orbitalis exist in young adults?\n    \nCorrect Answer: Yes\n\nDistractor 1: No, there is no association between chronotype and cortical thickness.\nDistractor 2: The study found that early chronotype individuals have thicker cortical thicknesses of left pars orbitalis.\nDistractor 3: There wasn't any correlation between chronotype and any cortical thickness but a relationship between chronotype and other aspects of human being was confirmed."

        "title": "Asylum-seeker women: Coping strategies and mental wellbeing.",
        "abstract": "Asylum seekers in Australia are subjected to various punitive measures that can affect their psychological wellbeing. The capacity of asylum seekers to adapt and cultivate effective coping strategies can enhance their resilience, facilitate their settlement processes and promote their overall mental health. This study aims to explore the coping strategies employed by women who are asylum-seekersthat have the potential to enhance their resilience post migration. A semi-structured qualitative study was conducted with asylum-seeker women from Iran. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. Seventeen participants described their experiences of applying various strategies to enhance their coping ability, resilience and maintain their mental wellbeing when facing ongoing challenges. Problem-solving strategies included social engagement, adjusting life plans and seeking support from formal and informal resources. Emotion-focussed strategies were positive thinking and maintaining hope, avoidance and spirituality. While emotion-focussed strategies enabled the women to manage their stresses temporarily, problem-solving strategies allowed them to effectively address the challenges they faced after migration. Providing supportive resources for asylum seekers, removing stigma and developing community ties may assist individuals in improving their coping skills, resilience and mental wellbeing.",
        "questions": "Question: Do asylum-seeker women use problem-solving strategies to address challenges post-migration.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: Yes\nDistractor 1: No coping strategies were identified in this study.\nDistractor 2: Emotion-focused strategies were the primary method used by asylum-seeker women to manage post-migration stress.\nDistractor 3: Only spiritual guidance was employed as a coping strategy among the women in the study."

        "title": "Network analysis of correlations between suicide exposure, depression, and anxiety symptoms in adolescents.",
        "abstract": "Adolescents with a history of suicide exposure, defined as experiencing the suicide death of a family member, friend, or other acquaintances, are more likely to experience mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. This study aimed to explore prevalence rates and the network of adolescents' suicide exposure, depression, and anxiety symptoms, and to clarify the correlations between suicide exposure and symptoms of depression and anxiety. A total of 8,957 adolescents were included in this cross-sectional study. Data regarding general information, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and suicide exposure were collected from mid-September to early October 2021. Network analysis was employed to assess relationships between suicide exposure and individual symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Central symptoms were identified by strength; the flow network was visualized to identify symptoms directly related to suicide exposure. The prevalence rates of suicide exposure, depression, and anxiety were 5.28%, 12.87%, and 10.48%. Results indicated that suicide exposure was associated with both depression and anxiety, and had the strongest positive association with suicidal ideation. Central symptoms of the network were sad mood, nervousness, fatigue, irritability, and uncontrollable worry. Bridge symptoms were suicidal ideation and irritability. Appetite changes, suicidal ideation, uncontrollable worry, sleep difficulties, and irritability were symptoms directly related to suicide exposure. There were significant inter-symptom associations between suicide exposure, depression, and anxiety in adolescents. It is recommended that future studies explore whether targeted interventions and long-term monitoring concerning these inter-symptom associations can protect adolescents with suicide exposure.",
        "questions": "Does an association exist between suicide exposure and depression in adolescents?\nHo: Yes\nSh: No\nHe: Only unsafe intervention strategies can solve this issue.\nAl: That these inter-symptom associations are unrelated to any other mental disorders."
